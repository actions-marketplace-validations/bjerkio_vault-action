# Vault Actions

A Github Action that pulls secrets from HashiCrop Vault.

**This Github Action is deprecated**: We encurage migrating to `hashicorp/vault-action`. Read more about it here: https://github.com/bjerkio/vault-action/issues/393

## Example Usage

```
jobs:
    build:
        steps:
            - uses: bjerkio/vault-action@v1.2.1
              with:
                endpoint: 'https://vault-host.io'
                path: 'kv/data/hello-world'
            - run: echo "${{ toJson(steps.vault.outputs.secret) }}" 
```

If the data is a JSON object, it will be transformed into multiple
objects. These are glued together as such:

Example JSON:
```
{
    "info": {
        "that": {
            "is": "deep"
        }
    }
}
```

This will be transformed to `steps.vault.outputs.info_that_is`

## Input

### `endpoint`

**Required** The URL of Vault Endpoint.

### `path`

Path to secret from Vault 

### `authMethod`

**Required** Type of authentication method. See below. 

### `exportVaultToken`

If this is set to `true` (default `false`) the vault token will be exported as `vault_token`

## Auth Methods

Currently, we only support Github Auth Method. We do appreciate help!
Submit a pull request if you wanna see more methods!

### Token

```
...
with:
    authMethod: 'token'
    token: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}
```

### Github Token

```
...
with:
    authMethod: 'github'
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
```

**PS:** You cannot use the built in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This is caused by the way
that Vault verifies the account (it needs to know _who_ is signing in.).

# Documentation
Apart from this README, you can find details and examples of using the SDK in the following places:  

- [Examples](examples/)
- [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions)

# Contribute

Feel free to open issues and pull requests. We appreciate all the help we can get!
At the moment, the most valuable are adding new auth methods, such as approle. We also really want to add E2E testing!

# Thanks tooâ€¦
